# QA Portfolio (Manual + Mobile + API + Theory + Jira)

This repository showcases my manual QA work across Web, Mobile, and API testing, plus core theory (SDLC, STLC, Bug Life Cycle) and black-box techniques. 
The structure is clean and hiring-manager friendly. All artifacts are bilingual-friendly (EN/GR).

## Structure
- `01-web-manual/` – Test plan, cases, defects, RTM, exploratory notes for a demo web app.
- `02-mobile/` – Mobile strategy, test cases, defects, exploratory notes, checklist.
- `03-api/` – Postman collection, screenshots, and report.
- `04-black-box-examples/` – Equivalence Partitioning, BVA, Decision Tables, State Transitions, Error Guessing.
- `05-theory/` – SDLC, STLC, Bug Life Cycle (diagram/notes).
- `jira-artifacts/` – Screenshots and exports from Jira (board, test cases, defects, traceability).

## How to use
- Replace demo names/links with what you actually test.
- Keep artifacts short, specific, and result-oriented.
- Prefer English for bug reports (common in remote roles).

## Day 1 Deliverables
- Repo skeleton & initial templates committed.
- README updated with your name and a one-liner headline.

> Tip: Keep commits small and descriptive, e.g., `docs(web): add test plan skeleton`.
